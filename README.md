#in-a-nutshell

`in-a-nutshell` creates a compressed summary of every text or article you give it.

##How it works
The principle behind `in-a-nutshell` is very simple. It first determines the relevant words
based on word frequency (excluding stop words) of a given text and then produces a summary out of the
sentences that include said key phrases.

Due to it's simple nature `in-a-nutshell` can be imprecise at times, especially when it comes to contents of fictional nature.
If you're looking for a more accurate solution, take a look at the [TF-IDF algorithm](https://github.com/NaturalNode/natural#tf-idf).

##Example

###Source

[Four super-heavy elements added to the periodic table on Wired](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2016-01/04/new-elements-periodic-table)

###Output
> Millions of science textbooks are now out of date as four new elements have been added
> to the periodic table.
>
> The four super-heavy elements, discovered by scientists from Japan, Russia and America,
> complete the seventh row of the table as they become the first additions since 2011.
>
> All of the new elements are man-made and were discovered by slamming lighter nuclei into each
> other and then tracking the decay of the radioactive elements.
>
> Their addition to the periodic table marks a significant scientific breakthrough, though
> the elements do not exist for long before they breakdown and become different elements.
>
> Relevant words: element, table...
